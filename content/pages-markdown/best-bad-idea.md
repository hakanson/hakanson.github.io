I receive a lot of enjoyment participating in the BEST BAD IDEA during [CISO Series](https://cisoseries.com/) Video Chat.  In the chat, attendees suggest bad ideas related to that weeks topic.  These are collected and used for various segments with the guests such as "Department of YES" where they have to agree with the idea,"Beat the BAD IDEA" where they need to implement compensating controls, or "What's Worse?" determining the worse of two bad ideas.  Each week the BEST bad idea wins an award and a really awesome CISO Series sweatshirt (repeat winners get a $25 Amazon gift card).
