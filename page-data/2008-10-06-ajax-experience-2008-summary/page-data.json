I asked about test double support (thinking about XHR), and he said that mock object is being looked at for 3.0.  It may work better than JSUnit, but doesn’t have the same style of test runner.  <a href=\"http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#THusted\">Ted Husted</a> uses the YUI test framework with Selenium to drive the tests.</p>\n<p>I did get <a href=\"http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#DCrockford\">Douglas Crockford</a> to sign my JavaScript: The Good Parts book during the signing session at the <a href=\"http://www.bookpool.com/\">Bookpool</a> table.  It was the only book that was sold out.  I should have been smarter and bought a bunch on day one, and sold them for a premium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#BDillard\">Brian Dillard</a> gave a (kind of boring) talk on <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/reallysimplehistory/\">Really Simple History</a>, which seems to be the best back button fixing code out there, but has a very out of date wiki.  He claims 0.8 is on his hard drive, waiting to be committed.  Other libraries seem to reuse the RSH code into their own, including a rewrite that runs as a jQuery plugin.  The original author of RHS was <a href=\"http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#BNeuberg\">Brad Neuberg</a>, who works at Google on the Gears team and gave an interesting talk on <a href=\"http://dojotoolkit.org/\">dojo</a> and <a href=\"http://gears.google.com/\">Gears</a>.</p>\n<p>On a lighter note - two Europeans, <a href=\"http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#PKoch\">Peter-Paul Koch</a> and <a href=\"http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/east/html/speakers.html#CHeilmann\">Christian Heilmann</a> had the most interesting hairstyles (but their pictures don’t give you the full effect).  Both were really nice guys to talk to.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Ajax Experience 2008 Summary","description":null,"date":"October 6, 2008","tags":["webdev","conference"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2008-10-06-ajax-experience-2008-summary","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-10-27-debugging-javascript-in-ie"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript","webdev"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","97908498"],"slicesMap":{}}
