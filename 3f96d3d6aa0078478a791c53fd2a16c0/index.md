First read [The ultimate, 3500-word, plain English guide to blockchain](https://thenextweb.com/evergreen/2017/07/04/ultimate-3500-word-plain-english-guide-blockchain/) all the way to the end where the author talks about a "51% Attack."

> The ability of someone controlling a majority of network hash rate to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from confirming.

Then read [Your ultimate guide to the upcoming fork that's splitting the Bitcoin community](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/07/24/ultimate-guide-upcoming-fork-thats-splitting-bitcoin-community/) and compare the SegWit fork (favored by users) against the SegWit2 fork (favored by miners).

If you buy into the argument that only those "with enough money to upgrade their computation power" will survive, then it seems like this could be the first step for a "51% Attack" on Bitcoin by state-level actors?

Alternatively, maybe I watched too much [The Lone Gunmen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243069/).
