As I was hydrating the backlog for this group, I used the Security Practices of the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (OWASP SAMM) as a categorization tool.  I liked this because it was both an established model, and could set up teams for future SAMM Assessments.</p>\n<p>The diagram and descriptions below come from the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project#tab=Browse_Online\">OWASP SAMM Project</a> website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

Guidance.”  One of the first things I learned was that “Deployment” was transitioning to be called “Operations” and that OWASP SAMM was previously referred to as <a href=\"http://www.opensamm.org/\">OpenSAMM</a>.</p>\n<p>Other than the item above, we didn’t want to focus on an “Governance” practices.  Many of our early ideas fell under the “Deployment -> Environment Hardening” (e.g. NGINX Security Lockdown) or the “Verification -> Security Testing” (e.g. Automate “Observatory by Mozilla” Scans) categories.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Categorizing Backlog Items using the OWASP SAMM Security Practices","description":null,"date":"May 15, 2018","tags":["security","owasp","agile"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-05-15-categorizing-backlog-items-using-the-owasp-samm-security-practices/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-04-27-content-security-policy-http-header-braindump/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["http","webdev","javascript","security"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-06-02-side-channel-attacking-browsers-through-css3-features/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["webdev","css","security"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","97908498"],"slicesMap":{}}
