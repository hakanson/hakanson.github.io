In a review of the technology goals, it was reinforced that products "will test DR" which triggered a flashback to Liam Neeson's speech from the 2008 movie [Taken](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/).

> _"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you."  
> [â€”Liam Neeson, Taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI)_

So I created a internet style meme to represent that if we don't test DR, someone will do it for us. Enjoy!
