When you push bad code to a web server, it’s not a big deal if there’s a critical mistake — you can just roll back the code, or roll forward with a fix, and all is well because you control the server. Or if the worst happens and there’s an active breach or a data leak, you can always stop the bleeding by shutting off your servers and disconnecting yourself from the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And before you think “our developers are better, this wouldn’t happen to us”, read this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.parity.io/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem/\">The developers here</a> were a cross-collaboration between the Ethereum foundation (literally the creators of Ethereum), the Parity core team, and members of the open-source community. It underwent extensive peer review. This is basically the highest standard of [programming] that exists in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not sure the takeaway here, other than to be cautious about over-committing on any blockchain / smart contract initiatives.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blockchain Programming vs. Web Development","description":null,"date":"July 21, 2017","tags":["blockchain"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017-07-21-blockchain-programming-vs-web-development","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-07-20-penetration-testing-secure-code-review-and-secure-design-review-threat-modeling"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["security","codequality"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-07-24-could-the-bitcoin-segwit-2x-fork-be-the-start-of-a-51-attack"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["random","security"]}}}},
