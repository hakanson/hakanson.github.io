CVE is a free dictionary of vulnerabilities…CVEs are used globally as a classification system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And appear in the NVD…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s important to note that CVE is not itself a database, but rather a dictionary of IDs…the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a database, and exposes the vulnerability information</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unless they don’t get a ID…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Receiving a CVE number requires the author or reporter to know about it in the first place, and then go through a certain amount of paperwork and filing effort.</p>\n<p>CVEs are in especially bad shape when it comes to known vulnerabilities in OSS packages. Based on a Snyk’s database as of October, 2017…a meager 11% of npm package vulnerabilities have such an ID.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or don’t get into the database…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet another lag takes place between the assignment of a CVE and posting it to NVD</p>\n<p>Known vulnerabilities that are not on NVD are still known, but harder to detect. Library vulnerabilities are likely to either have no CVE, not be listed on NVD</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Known vulnerabilities are not as simple as they initially appear. The definition of what’s considered known and the management of the vulnerability metadata are very hard to do well.</p>\n<p>CVE and NVD work well for curating vulnerabilities in commercial products, but do not scale to the volume and ownership model of open source projects. Over time, these standards may evolve to meet this demand, but right now their coverage and detail level are not enough to protect your libraries.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"What defines a known open source vulnerability?","date":"February 08, 2018","tags":["opensource","security"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-02-08-what-defines-a-known-open-source-vulnerability","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-02-07-referrer-policy-http-header"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["http","webdev","security"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-02-09-marking-http-pages-as-not-secure"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["http","webdev","security"]}}}}}
