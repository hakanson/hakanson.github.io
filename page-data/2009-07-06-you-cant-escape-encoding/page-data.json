Since printable ISO-8859-1 characters (aka Latin 1 or upper ASCII) are in the range of 0xA0 - 0xFF - they fall into this category.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BYTE 1 = 1100 0000 | (0001 1111 &#x26; b)<br>\nBTYE 2 = 1000 0000 | (0011 1111 &#x26; b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So for a character like é (Latin Small Letter E with Acute)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>é = 233 = 0xE9 = 1110 1011</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>when it’s UTF-8 encoded</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1100 0011 1010 1001 = 0xC3 0xA9 = Ã©</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice that when encoding ISO-8859-1 with UTF-8 and you happen to view the output as ISO-8859-1, the first character of the two is always a capital A with some variation. The following table can help describe why.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>range byte 1 display char<br>\n0x80 - 0x9F (128-159) 0xC0 À<br>\n0xA0 - 0xBF (160-191) 0xC1 Á<br>\n0xC0 - 0xDF (192-223) 0xC2 Â<br>\n0xE0 - 0xFF (224-255) 0xC3 Ã</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another “odd” situation exists when the Copyright Sign or Pound Sign value from unicode</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>© = 169 = 0xA9 = 1010 1001<br>\n£ = 163 = 0xA3 = 1010 0011</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is UTF-8 encoded, and become the Â character followed by themselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1100 0010 1010 1001 = 0xC3 0xA9 = Â©<br>\n1100 0010 1010 0011 = 0XC3 0xA3 = Â£</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"You can’t escape encoding","date":"July 06, 2009","tags":["webdev"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-07-06-you-cant-escape-encoding","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2008-10-27-debugging-javascript-in-ie"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript","webdev"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2009-08-03-javascript-vs-json-encoding"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript"]}}}}}
