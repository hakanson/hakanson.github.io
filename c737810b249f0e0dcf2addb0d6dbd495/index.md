While attending AWS re:Invent 2016, I participated in the [AWS re:Invent Alexa Skill Contest](https://www.hackster.io/contests/alexa-reinvent).  I didn't win the $10,000 grand prize but was one of the finalists. See [Crowning the New Amazon Alexa Champ at AWS re:Invent](https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/crowning-the-new-amazon-alexa-champ-at-aws-re-invent-85a55479fabf#.w1oqsrnyf) for a recap of the contest.  Mars Rover Mission is an adventure game where you control a Mars exploration rover. It is slow-paced in that you can only take one turn per day exploring the Martian surface.

At this point, I know you must be too excited to keep reading, so turn to your Echo and say:

> "Alexa, enable Mars Rover Mission"

Alternatively, enable Mars Rover Mission via the Alexa app or at [Amazon.com: Mars Rover Mission: Alexa Skills](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N002EZY).

If you want more of the technical details (including links to the JavaScript [code](https://github.com/kjhsoftware/mars-rover-mission), how to cheat, and the [demo video](https://youtu.be/P4A-EMxqtuk) I recorded at 4 am), take a look at the project writeup:  [Mars Rover Mission: A slow paced adventure game. - Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/kevin-hakanson/mars-rover-mission-a-slow-paced-adventure-game-971ae2) 

If you don't own an Amazon Echo, and can't buy one because they are out of stock, try out the browser based [Alexa Skill Testing Tool - Echosim.io](https://echosim.io/).
