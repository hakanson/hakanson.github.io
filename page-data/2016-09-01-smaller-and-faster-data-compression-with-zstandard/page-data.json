Zstandard combines recent compression breakthroughs, like <a href=\"https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy\">Finite State Entropy</a>, with a performance-first design — and then optimizes the implementation for the unique properties of modern CPUs. As a result, it improves upon the trade-offs made by other compression algorithms and has a wide range of applicability with very high decompression speed. Zstandard, available now under the BSD license, is designed to be used in nearly every lossless compression [1] scenario, including many where current algorithms aren’t applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “internet standard” today is Deflate, which is used by zip, gzip, and zlib. When compared to zlib, Facebook shows that zstandard scales much better:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>At the same compression ratio, it compresses substantially faster: ~3-5x.</li>\n<li>At the same compression speed, it is substantially smaller: 10-15 percent smaller.</li>\n<li>It is almost 2x faster at decompression, regardless of compression ratio; the command line tooling numbers show an even bigger difference: more than 3x faster.</li>\n<li>It scales to much higher compression ratios, while sustaining lightning-fast decompression speeds.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article continues with an “under the hood” section talking about “parallel execution” and “branchless design” and how those are important to today’s CPU architectures.  Good reading for those propeller-heads out there.</p>\n<p>One of their highlighted use cases is storing “small data”; some examples are pages in a database or JSON documents.  They also mention that compressed data stored on SSDs help with both IOPs and the write endurance of the hardware.  Facebook stores a lot of data and buys a lot of SSDs, so I can see how this will save them money.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Smaller and faster data compression with Zstandard","description":null,"date":"September 1, 2016","tags":["webdev"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016-09-01-smaller-and-faster-data-compression-with-zstandard","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-08-22-investigating-cloudtrail-for-s3-putbucketnotification"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","cloudtrail","s3"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-09-06-hpkp-and-ransompkp"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["http","security","webdev"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","97908498"]}
