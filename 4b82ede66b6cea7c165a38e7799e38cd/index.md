You may (or may not) have seen: [Kevin Hakanson on Twitter: "@richcampbell @jhusain great show; I especially liked the comment selected (thanks for the mug)](https://twitter.com/hakanson/status/565549181792972800)

On 21 January 2015, I was listing to Todd Gardner ([@toddhgardner](https://twitter.com/toddhgardner)) on [.NET Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1090) talk about "Duck Punching" when he and host Richard Campbell ([@richcampbell](https://twitter.com/richcampbell)) were talking about validating the checksums of JavaScript libraries served by CDNs to ensure you were being delivered the code you were expecting.  This is a topic I have blogged about before:  [CDN Hosting of JavaScript and Information Security Aspects](../2014-07-03-cdn-hosting-of-javascript-and-information-security-aspects)

So, I made a comment that day, pointing them to the W3C [Content Security Policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/content-security-policy/) Editor's Draft where it says:

> Individual inline scripts and stylesheets may be whitelisted via nonces (as described in §4.2.4 Valid Nonces) and hashes (as described in §4.2.5 Valid Hashes).

Only 9 days later, on 30 January 2015, I got an email stating my comment was selected.  Most of the time, the comment selected is from many months before, when that particular guest or topic was last discussed.  I was surprised to have both a comment selected and such a quick turnaround.  I sent them my address, got my free mug, and started wondering when my comment would air.  Finally, on 11 February 2015, I was listening to [Digging into Javascript 6 with Jafar Husain](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1099) and I heard my comment.

Not quite as cool as being on the .NET Rocks! podcast, but I'll take what I can get - even if that is a free coffee mug.
