During a product design session, we had a discussion on Global Search covering "what search is" and "what search should be."  I used the following example of question answering as where I see "global search" heading:

I can search Google for **US population** and it will give me an answer

[![Google "US population"](images/Google+-+US+population.png)](images/Google+-+US+population.png)

I can also search for **2014 google revenue**

[![Google "2014 google revenue"](images/Google+-+revenue.png)](images/Google+-+revenue.png)

I can even ask Google about revenue in the form of a question: **how much money did google make in 2014**

[![Google "how much money did google make in 2014"](images/Google+-+how.png)](images/Google+-+how.png)

However, when I asked a question requiring a computation, I got search results and not an answer:Â  **2014 google revenue per US population**

[![Google "2014 google revenue per US population"](images/Google+-+revenue+per+US.png)](images/Google+-+revenue+per+US.png)

When I ask WolframAlpha that same question, I got an answer:
