CloudFront already allows you to configure custom error pages or generate redirects with Lambda@Edge if your origin is unavailable. Now with Origin Failover, you can easily setup failover logic between combinations of AWS origins or non-AWS custom HTTP origins such that there is minimal interruption to your viewer’s experience. </p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"CloudFront and Disaster Recovery: Part 2","description":null,"date":"November 21, 2018","tags":["aws","cloudfront","disasterrecovery"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-11-21-cloudfront-and-disaster-recovery-part-2/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-11-21-aws-cloud9-and-sharing-with-role-issue/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","cloud9","iam"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-12-04-amazon-dynamodb-deep-dive-advanced-design-patterns-for-dynamodb-dat401/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","dynamodb","nosql","database"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","97908498"],"slicesMap":{}}
