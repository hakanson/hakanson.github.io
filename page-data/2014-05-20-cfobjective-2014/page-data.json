To limit the access to the PerformanceResourceTiming interface, the same origin policy is enforced by default and certain attributes are set to zero, as described in Section 4.5 Cross-origin Resources. Resource providers can explicitly allow all timing information to be collected for a resource by adding the Timing-Allow-Origin HTTP response header, which specifies the domains that are allowed to access the timing information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/using-owasp-zap-to-find-vulnerabilities-in-your-web-apps/\">Using OWASP ZAP to find vulnerabilities in your web apps</a> -</li>\n</ul>\n<p>David Epler (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcepler\">@dcepler</a>) -\r\nTo get good at writing secure software, you really should try and hack your own code - ZAP is a tool that can help you do that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/web-components-are-awesome-and-polymer-too/\">Web Components are Awesome (and Polymer too)</a> -</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elliott Sprehn (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElliottZ\">@ElliottZ</a>) -\r\n<a href=\"http://elliottsprehn.com/preso/webcomponents/\">slides</a> -\r\nElliott is the tech lead for the web components effort at Google, so he seemed qualified to speak on this topic.  His HTML5 based slide deck was written using Web Components (you can view source and look for <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;sd-deck></code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;sd-slide></code> elements).  He also helped me make progress on an open Chromium bug I submitted last fall:  <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=304722\">Issue 304722 -  chromium -  Intl NumberFormat minimumFractionDigits options property not honored</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/leveling-up-at-javascript-understanding-the-confusing-bits/\">Leveling Up at Javascript: Understanding the Confusing bits - cf.Objective()</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jason Dean(12Robots) (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JasonPDean\">@JasonPDean</a>) -\r\nJason is also from MN and the person who shared the call for speakers with the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptMN/\">JavaScriptMN Meetup</a> group last fall.  His presentation was more intro level, but he had great examples of JavaScript variable <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting\">hoisting</a> which validated his session title by confusing the audience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/panel-discussion-why-client-side/\">Panel Discussion: Why Client-Side?</a> -</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nothing really new in this moderator led panel discussion on client-side vs. server side development, but it did validate that this is a common issue faced by many web developers.  The answer almost always was that “it depends.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/sessions/futurejs-an-introduction-to-ecmascript-6-e2809charmonye2809d/\">FutureJS: An Introduction to ECMAScript 6 “Harmony”</a> -</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Marcin Szczepanski (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcinS\">@MarcinS</a>) -\r\nMarcin traveled from Australia where he works at <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\">Atlassian</a>.  ECMAScript 6 is adding new language features and syntactic sugar to JavaScript.  Marcin even updated Jason’s var hoisting examples, by converting them to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\">let</a>, which gives JavaScript block scope local variables.  It will be a bit before the browsers catch up (took about 4 years for ECMAScript 5), but until then you always have transpilers:  <a href=\"https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler\">google/traceur-compiler · GitHub</a></p>\n<p>The full <a href=\"http://www.cfobjective.com/schedule/\">schedule</a> has many more topics with the final slide decks to be available on <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ColdFusionConference\">slideshare</a> soon.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"cf.Objective() 2014","description":null,"date":"May 20, 2014","tags":["javascript","encryption","security","conference"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2014-05-20-cfobjective-2014/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-01-17-json-ld-is-an-official-web-standard/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["architecture"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-06-01-i-love-to-talk-i-hate-to-type/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["random","vui"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","97908498"],"slicesMap":{}}
