For my company's **2025 Customer Challenge**, my finalist pitch included a live demo.  Teams were allowed 3 minutes of pitch time, and I allocated about 30 seconds for this demo.  Things didn't go exactly as planned, but they did work out in the end. Why take the risk of a live demo?  Because my mentor, said it would be "awesome" - and he was right.

When my mentor first mentioned the demo idea, I wasn't sure how I was going to build it.  As luck would have it, I saw an internal posting highlighting an IBM partnership on October 8.  (Luck being defined by the famous quote: "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity")  IBM Watson Developer Cloud has services for both [Text to Speech](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html) and [Speech to Text](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html), including sample code that runs in the browser.  This looked promising given my JavaScript and web development background. I spent the following weekend understanding the sample code and getting those projects running.  Then, a couple of nights of some ugly code hacking and I had a demo to present.

I'm glad the demo (mostly) worked out, but I'm even happier that I got to write some code and learn something new.
