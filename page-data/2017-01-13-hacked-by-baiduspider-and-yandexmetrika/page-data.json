It appears that these spiders and bots didn’t have updated DNS records, and the external IP that AWS assigned my web app must have previously been used by the wix.com hosting platform.  They were just trying to reindex the web based on outdated info.  My web app was a victim of mistaken identity, not elite hackers from China and Russia.</p>\n<p>Because this was for a simple test, I had used <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html\">The Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI)</a> to make things easy and let it pick the defaults. This created a security group that allowed anyone to connect to port 80 - as you would expect for a public web site.  However, since this was only a test for me, I updated the incoming rule only to allow my IP range.  This stopped the extra log entries from being created.</p>\n<p>So, why am I posting this since getting “hacked” by a web spider doesn’t contribute to my “street cred” very much?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reminder that you can’t control external traffic and as soon as something appears on the internet, it will be found.  Everything from our sandbox testing to our production systems needs to understand this and plan for it.</li>\n<li>A realization that at the time I was a bit unclear of what to do next if this had been hackers.  I am going to follow up internally on this topic.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"\"Hacked\" by Baiduspider and YandexMetrika","date":"January 13, 2017","tags":["aws","xray","security","monitoring"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-01-13-hacked-by-baiduspider-and-yandexmetrika","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-12-21-my-first-published-alexa-skill-mars-rover-mission"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["alexa","javascript","vui","conference"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-01-15-aws-x-ray-investigation"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","xray","javascript","monitoring"]}}}}}
