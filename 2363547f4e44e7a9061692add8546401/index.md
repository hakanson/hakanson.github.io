If you know me, you won't be surprised that I love to talk. What you may not know, is that I hate to type. Between my poor spelling and my constant typos, I think the `delete` key accounts for about 50% of my keystrokes. In fact, typing class was the only B-grade in my high school career. 25 years later and I'm not that much better.

On iOS, Siri gives you exceptional dictation abilities. Recently, I heard about a new iOS application from Scott Hanselman ([@shanselman](https://twitter.com/shanselman)), one of my favorite Microsoft employees. He was able to leverage Siri on iOS to do dictation into any Windows application. Learn more about it at [myEcho: Bringing iOS quality speech recognition and dictation to Windows](http://myechoapp.com/) and read about how it was built using C# on his blog: [We are abstracting on the shoulders of giants](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WeAreAbstractingOnTheShouldersOfGiants.aspx).

That made me wonder - can my Mac do dictation? A quick Google search indicated that it could, and it was easy to use. To prove it, I dictated the first draft of this blog post.Â  Learn how to enable diction on your Mac: [Mac Basics: Dictation lets you speak text instead of typing](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5449).

Do you speak to your computer and expect it to listen?
