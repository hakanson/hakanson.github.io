Ran across this series of posts on DevOps:

* [DevOps and the Myth of Efficiency, Part I | Java Code Geeks](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/12/devops-myth-efficiency-part.html)
* [DevOps and the Myth of Efficiency, Part II | Java Code Geeks](http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/12/devops-myth-efficiency-part-ii.html)

They draw a distinction between "complicated" and "complex" and make statements like "efficiency is no longer enough."  Part II refers to the success of “systems thinking” at NASA in the 1960s and ends with the summary below.

It’s laying the groundwork to treat our organizations as complex systems, not machines. This approach lends itself to _really understanding_ the value of **feedback**, **failure**, **learning**, **autonomy**, and **emergent behavior** which are critical for any complex system to exhibit to evolve and stay relevant in a complex, not merely complicated, world.
