Do you remember [Internet mapping turned a remote farm into a digital hell | Fusion](http://fusion.net/story/287592/internet-mapping-glitch-kansas-farm/)? Some summary points from the article:

> * When MaxMind was first choosing the default point on its digital map for the center of the U.S., it decided to clean up the measurements and go with a simpler, nearby latitude and longitude: 38°N 97°W or 38.0000,-97.0000.
> * Every time MaxMind’s database has been queried about the location of an IP address in the United States it can’t identify, it has spit out the default location of a spot two hours away from the geographic center of the country.
> * There are now over 600 million IP addresses associated with that default coordinate.
> * This happens to be in the front yard of Joyce Taylor’s house.

Well, it looks like that is no longer the case: [This is the new digital center of the United States](http://fusion.kinja.com/this-is-the-new-digital-center-of-the-united-states-1793856143)

Maybe it was the result of a sign like this in Joyce Taylor's front yard.
