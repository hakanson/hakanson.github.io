Our customers remain protected thanks to modern standards like <a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FHTTP%2FCSP&#x26;data=02%7C01%7C%7C1637778c952e44c3f3d908d623f92679%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636735950338487722&#x26;sdata=0kd8LS0AikL0iBKIXI0ZEhUhsrdHVeP3ye4k%2FWlJtpA%3D&#x26;reserved=0\">Content Security Policy</a>, which provide more powerful, performant and secure mechanisms to protect against content injection attacks, with <a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcaniuse.com%2F%23search%3Dcontent%2520security%2520policy&#x26;data=02%7C01%7C%7C1637778c952e44c3f3d908d623f92679%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636735950338487722&#x26;sdata=Kev9PTWrQ%2BRxjEgggBqCNJrQjdNnRqXxWHf8vpz29vI%3D&#x26;reserved=0\">high compatibility across modern browsers</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>MDN Web Docs for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection\">X-XSS-Protection</a> also refer to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP\">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> as the preferred solution</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The HTTP <code class=\"language-text\">X-XSS-Protection</code> response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XSS\">XSS</a>) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy\"><code class=\"language-text\">Content-Security-Policy</code></a> that disables the use of inline JavaScript (<code class=\"language-text\">&#39;unsafe-inline&#39;</code>), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don’t yet support <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSP\">CSP</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now go back to <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/xss-protection-disappears-from-microsoft-edge\">XSS protection disappears from Microsoft Edge</a> and see their analysis.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The XSS Filter is supposed to be on by default,” Heyes explained. “However, it is now off by default, and even if you try to turn it on with <code class=\"language-text\">X-XSS-Protection: 1</code> it remains off.”</p>\n<p>“The only way to actually turn it on now is when you have the header <code class=\"language-text\">X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block</code>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, unless you are targeting IE11 (see <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy\">https://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy</a>), it seems like it is time to embrace the <a href=\"../2018-04-27-content-security-policy-http-header-braindump\">Content-Security-Policy HTTP Header Braindump</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"X-XSS-Protection is Dead, Long Live Content-Security-Policy","description":null,"date":"October 11, 2018","tags":["http","webdev","security"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-10-11-x-xss-protection-is-dead-long-live-content-security-policy","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-09-06-aws-shield-readonly-and-not-authorized-to-perform-shieldgetsubscriptionstate-work-around"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","iam","security"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-10-17-full-stack-caching-strategy"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["webdev","caching","http"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","3567236516"]}
