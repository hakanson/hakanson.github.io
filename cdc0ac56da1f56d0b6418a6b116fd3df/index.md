I saw this book review on Twitter today:  [Production-Ready Microservices: Building Standardized Systems Across An Engineering Organization By Susan J. Fowler](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/3222-production-ready-microservices-building-standardized-systems-across-an-engineering-organization-by-susan-j-fowler.htm)

And when I saw it was an O'Reilly book, I knew I was be able to access it through Safari Books Online.  If the overview below looks interesting, check it out at [Production-Ready Microservices: Safari Books Online - Premium](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/9781491965962) 

> One of the biggest challenges for organizations that have adopted microservice architecture is the lack of architectural, operational, and organizational standardization. After splitting a monolithic application or building a microservice ecosystem from scratch, many engineers are left wondering what’s next. In this practical book, author Susan Fowler presents a set of microservice standards in depth, drawing from her experience standardizing over a thousand microservices at Uber. You’ll learn how to design microservices that are stable, reliable, scalable, fault tolerant, performant, monitored, documented, and prepared for any catastrophe.
