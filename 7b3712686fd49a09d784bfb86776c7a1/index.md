"Security" as a topic or category can be confusing without additional context. This document attempts to categorize information security topics using industry standard groupings.

My internal cloud security group has created a plan which lists cloud security controls required, along with their ISO 27001 mappings. [ISO 27001](http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27002.html) groups security controls into various sections that we use in our policy framework as categories.  This list appears more Enterprise IT focused and includes:

> 5: Information security policies  
> 6: Organization of information security  
> 7: Human resource security   
> 8: Asset management  
> 9: Access control  
> 10: Cryptography  
> 11: Physical and environmental security  
> 12: Operations management  
> 13: Communications security  
> 14: System acquisition, development and maintenance  
> 15: Supplier relationships  
> 16: Information security incident management  
> 17: Information security aspects of business continuity management  
> 18: Compliance  

Another way to classify information security topics is with the 8 [CISSP Domains](https://www.isc2.org/cissp-domains/default.aspx), which are standard knowledge groupings for Information Security professionals.

> * Security and Risk Management
> * Asset Security
> * Security Architecture and Engineering
> * Communications and Network Security
> * Identity and Access Management
> * Security Assessment and Testing
> * Security Operations
> * Software Development Security

A web application developer might think more in terms of the [Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://www.owasp.org/images/d/d8/OpenSAMM_Core_V1-1-Final.pdf) from OWASP when thinking about security related to building products for customers.

> SAMM is built upon a collection of Security Practices that are tied back into the core Business Functions involved in software development.
>
> * Governance (Strategy & Metrics; Policy & Compliance; Education & Guidance)
> * Construction (Threat Assessment; Security Requirements; Secure Architecture)
> * Verification (Design Review; Implementation Review; Security Testing)
> * Operations (Issue Management; Environment Hardening; Operational Enablement)

The SAMM groupings might be the best mental modal for product teams.  However, these is still work in understanding how ISO 27001 controls fit into the responsibility matrix.
