It uses the same technology that is used by Microsoft Office and Bing, and is built on our many years of experience with natural language processing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, a question from the Azure Forum asks:  <a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/cc86f15f-4e39-44a1-9e81-1bdcb63c8801/azure-search-service-hosted-elastic-search?forum=azuresearch\">Azure Search Service = Hosted Elastic Search?</a>  With snippets from the answer including “Azure Search uses Elasticsearch as an underlying full-text search engine” and “ElasticSearch is great but we see it as an implementation detail.”</p>\n<p>It turns out that the years of natural language processing resulted in switching out the Lucene analyzers: e.g.  <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;analyzer&quot; : &quot;en-lucene&quot;</code> vs <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;analyzer&quot; : &quot;en-microsoft&quot;</code></p>\n<p>The goals of this research were to understand what search-as-a-service means: What are the key features and what implementation details to watch out for?  The documentation reinforced the same message I have been hearing about Elastic:  Don’t just drop in JSON - you need to understand your data and structure your indexes.  Also, don’t use as a primary data store because you will need to make changes and re-index (which may require a reload).  On the topic of document level security, the Access and Control session of the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798933.aspx\">Azure Search Overview</a> states “There is no per-user authentication or authorization model. However, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">$filter</code> to restrict access by user identity” which is consistent with other sources on Elastic.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Azure \"Search-as-a-Service\"","description":null,"date":"June 03, 2015","tags":["azure","search","nlp"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015-06-03-azure-search-as-a-service","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-06-01-global-search-box-as-question-answering"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["search","ux","nlp"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-09-21-2025-customer-challenge"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["innovation"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","3567236516"]}
