The other day, my daughter had me search for [zigzagoon](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=zigzagoon) on [Wolfram|Alpha: Computational Knowledge Engine](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).  Apparently, there is a full Pokédex loaded because it knew details like number, type, size, and generation.

So, I tried this computation...

and it worked as expected!

How is this relevant to the capabilities we are developing around how knowledge workers **Find**, **Analyze**, and **Decide** about **Content**?  Now think again about the Wolfram|Alpha Pokémon example and how that combines natural language input and content to recommend an answer.  Then go to [https://www.wolframalpha.com/](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) and try some queries out yourself.  How does the user experience compare to more traditional research products?
