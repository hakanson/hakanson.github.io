[Chrome Dev Summit 2015 Notes](https://danoc.me/blog/chrome-dev-summit-2015-notes/) is a summary by Daniel O'Connor of the presentations from the Chrome Dev Summit 2015, along with links to the videos.  The term "RAIL" appeared in many of the session titles and is defined below:

> RAIL: Response, Animation, Idle, and Load
>
> * Response (100ms): The user feels an instantaneous response because the paint occurred quickly after click.
> * Animation (16ms): Visual changes feel smooth and consistent.
> * Idle (50ms): User isn’t interacting with the page yet, but they will be soon. This time should be used to proactively schedule work that will be completed in 50ms chunks.
> * Load (1s): Getting the first meaningful paint
