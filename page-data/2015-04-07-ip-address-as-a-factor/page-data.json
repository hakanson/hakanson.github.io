At a high level, these elements can be broken down into three categories: the principal itself (the user, device, or service requesting access), the credential the principal submits (shared key, one-time password, digital certificate, or biometric credential), and the contextual information describing the transaction (location, time of day, software state, and so on)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I like the fact this article adds <strong>contextual information</strong> separate from the credential.  IP address information seems to fit in this category.</p>\n<p>Is it correct to state that IP Address is not an additional factor for authentication, but it is additional context that can be taken into account to add security?  Is this really authorization at this point?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"IP Address as a factor?","description":null,"date":"April 07, 2015","tags":["security","networking"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2015-04-07-ip-address-as-a-factor","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-04-01-facebook-graphqlrelay-and-netflix-falcor"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["webdev","api","graphql"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-04-10-webstorm-10-and-typescript-support"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript","typescript","webdev"]}}}},
