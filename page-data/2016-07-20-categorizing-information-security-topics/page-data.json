This document attempts to categorize information security topics using industry standard groupings.</p>\n<p>My internal cloud security group has created a plan which lists cloud security controls required, along with their ISO 27001 mappings. <a href=\"http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27002.html\">ISO 27001</a> groups security controls into various sections that we use in our policy framework as categories.  This list appears more Enterprise IT focused and includes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5: Information security policies<br>\n6: Organization of information security<br>\n7: Human resource security<br>\n8: Asset management<br>\n9: Access control<br>\n10: Cryptography<br>\n11: Physical and environmental security<br>\n12: Operations management<br>\n13: Communications security<br>\n14: System acquisition, development and maintenance<br>\n15: Supplier relationships<br>\n16: Information security incident management<br>\n17: Information security aspects of business continuity management<br>\n18: Compliance  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another way to classify information security topics is with the 8 <a href=\"https://www.isc2.org/cissp-domains/default.aspx\">CISSP Domains</a>, which are standard knowledge groupings for Information Security professionals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Security and Risk Management</li>\n<li>Asset Security</li>\n<li>Security Architecture and Engineering</li>\n<li>Communications and Network Security</li>\n<li>Identity and Access Management</li>\n<li>Security Assessment and Testing</li>\n<li>Security Operations</li>\n<li>Software Development Security</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A web application developer might think more in terms of the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/images/d/d8/OpenSAMM_Core_V1-1-Final.pdf\">Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)</a> from OWASP when thinking about security related to building products for customers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SAMM is built upon a collection of Security Practices that are tied back into the core Business Functions involved in software development.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Governance (Strategy &#x26; Metrics; Policy &#x26; Compliance; Education &#x26; Guidance)</li>\n<li>Construction (Threat Assessment; Security Requirements; Secure Architecture)</li>\n<li>Verification (Design Review; Implementation Review; Security Testing)</li>\n<li>Operations (Issue Management; Environment Hardening; Operational Enablement)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The SAMM groupings might be the best mental modal for product teams.  However, these is still work in understanding how ISO 27001 controls fit into the responsibility matrix.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Categorizing Information Security Topics","date":"July 20, 2016","tags":["security"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2016-07-20-categorizing-information-security-topics","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-07-20-zipkin-js-investigation-part-2"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript","api","monitoring"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-07-29-net-zipkin-investigation-medidatazipkintracermodule"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["dotnet","api","monitoring"]}}}}}
