The automatic credential rotation above means that even the DBA doesn’t know the password.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if that would work for one of my application teams using RDS PostgreSQL.  I reached out to the DBA, who had been wanting automated password rotation in place for a while.  However, some of the microservices were “optimized” to access the Config Server during startup.  This meant that if the password were changed, that service would be broken until a restart.</p>\n<p>Not being a PostgreSQL security expert, I wondered if there were concepts of users and roles.  In researching how to solve this problem, I found <a href=\"http://davidhollenberger.com/2017/03/16/postgres-credential-rotation/\">Postgres Credential Rotation</a> presented a possible solution.  Here is a snippet from that article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sql\"><pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> role foo nologin<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> role foo_a <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> encrypted password <span class=\"token string\">'md5...'</span> login<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">create</span> role foo_b <span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> encrypted password <span class=\"token string\">'md5...'</span> nologin<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">grant</span> foo <span class=\"token keyword\">to</span> foo_a<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">grant</span> foo <span class=\"token keyword\">to</span> foo_b<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This gets us most of the way to a seamless credential rotation. The issue I ran into next was any new objects created by foo_a or foo_b users were owned by foo_a and foo_b respectively. To ensure all objects created by foo_a and foo_b are owned by the group user foo we need to override their default role.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"sql\"><pre class=\"language-sql\"><code class=\"language-sql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">alter</span> role foo_a <span class=\"token keyword\">set</span> role foo<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">alter</span> role foo_b <span class=\"token keyword\">set</span> role foo<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The DBA agreed this model was workable as we already implemented the user and role pattern (albeit with a single user).  Adding additional users would require some modification to utility scripts but would work.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Database Credential Rotation in PostgreSQL","date":"April 09, 2018","tags":["aws","secretsmanager","database","security"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-04-09-database-credential-rotation-in-postgresql","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-03-20-aws-options-for-blocking-ip-addresses"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","security","networking"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-04-10-secrets-management"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["security","podcast"]}}}}}
