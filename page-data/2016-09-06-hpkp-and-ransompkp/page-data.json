Alternatively, you can implement HPKP yourself (and only be a little scared).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"HPKP and RansomPKP","date":"September 06, 2016","tags":["http","security","webdev"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2016-09-06-hpkp-and-ransompkp","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-09-01-smaller-and-faster-data-compression-with-zstandard"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["webdev"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-10-11-i-have-people-skills"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["career"]}}}}}
