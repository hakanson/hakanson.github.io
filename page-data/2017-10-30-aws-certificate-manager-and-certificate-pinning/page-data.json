If the certificate to which you pin is replaced, your application will fail to connect. If your use case requires pinning, we recommend that you pin to a CA rather than to an individual certificate. If you are pinning to an Amazon Trust Services CA, you should pin to all CAs shown in the table earlier in this post.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It wasn’t mentioned in that blog posting, but AWS Certificate Manager works with CAA Records (see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/setup-caa.html\">(Optional) Configure a CAA Record</a>) and as of August 2017 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/08/amazon-route-53-now-supports-caa-records/\">Amazon Route 53 now supports CAA records</a>.</p>\n<p>It Seems like we don’t want to <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pin-one-s-hopes-on\">pin one’s hopes on</a> HPKP.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AWS Certificate Manager and Certificate Pinning","date":"October 30, 2017","tags":["aws","http","security"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-10-30-aws-certificate-manager-and-certificate-pinning","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-10-22-using-the-virtual-mfa-device-with-the-aws-cli"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","cli","iam","mfa","security"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-12-12-cloudfront-and-disaster-recovery"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","cloudfront","disasterrecovery"]}}}}}
