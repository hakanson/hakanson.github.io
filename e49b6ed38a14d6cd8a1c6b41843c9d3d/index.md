As newer products are dealing more with uploaded user content than just searching and displaying company content, I was curious about how fast their internet connections are.  I know my online backup trickles compared to my download speeds, so I wondered if it was the same for our customers.  I just ran across [Analyze > Summarize > Nationwide - National Broadband Map](http://www.broadbandmap.gov/summarize/nationwide/speedtest-upload), which

> "is a summary of the broadband characteristics for the area listed above. The broadband data below is as of December 31, 2010 and represents data collected by SBDD grantees."

Here is a snippet of the upload speed section of the report.
