The premise was that much of cloud configuration monitoring is point-in-time evaluations, but there is additional value in monitoring the change in state of these resource configurations.</p>\n<p>For a definition of <strong>state</strong>, I leveraged language from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)\">State (Computer Science)</a> entry on Wikipedia.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A specialized definition of state is used for computer programs that operate sequentially on streams of data.</li>\n<li>Information about previous data received is stored and used to affect the processing of the current data.</li>\n<li>This is called a stateful protocol and the data carried over from the previous processing cycle is called the state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I then proposed this for the definition of <strong>Cloud State Monitoring</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Treats cloud resource changes as a stream of data and intelligently monitors both the current data as well as changes from the previous data (state).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A few of the examples I highlighted were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor current data for security misconfigurations</li>\n<li>Monitor changes in data for configuration drift</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I think about who is making changes, it is both you (as the customer)…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workload teams releasing software</li>\n<li>Platform teams enhancing automation</li>\n<li>Security teams updating policies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…and the cloud provider themselves.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding new cloud-native service features</li>\n<li>Updating versions of hosted open-source software</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I recorded and edited the presentation, including adding a full transcript for closed caption viewing.
