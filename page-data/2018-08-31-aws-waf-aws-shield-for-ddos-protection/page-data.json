Layer 3 and 4 attacks correspond to the Network and Transport layers of the OSI model. We’ll refer to these collectively as <em>infrastructure layer attacks</em>. Layer 6 and 7 attacks correspond to the Presentation and Application layers of the OSI model. We’ll address these together as <em>application layer attacks</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mitigation Techniques section starting on Page 7 highlights AWS Shield Advanced as a way to mitigate DDoS attacks.  The network level protection is most helpful for Infrastructure Layer Defense, but one of the many items included with the AWS Shield Advanced subscription is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to AWS WAF, at no additional cost, for the mitigation of application layer DDoS attacks (when used with Amazon CloudFront or ALB).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AWS WAF helps with Application Layer Defense but “requires you to implement an architecture that allows you to<br>\nspecifically detect, scale to absorb, and block malicious requests.”  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/protect-web-sites-services-using-rate-based-rules-for-aws-waf/\">Protect Web Sites &#x26; Services Using Rate-Based Rules for AWS WAF</a> showcases a good rule to start with, even if used in count mode.  Moving beyond DDoS attacks applications can look at <a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/aws-waf-owasp.pdf\">Use AWS WAF to Mitigate OWASP’s Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities</a>, but these require synergy with the application architecture.</p>\n<p>The DDoS whitepaper also highlights Operational Techniques such as Visibility.  Included with AWS Shield Advanced is access to a number of additional CloudWatch metrics.  However, these are only valuable when monitored.</p>\n<p>Give the whitepaper a read through.  What key points do you see highlighted?</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AWS WAF / AWS Shield for DDoS Protection","description":null,"date":"August 31, 2018","tags":["aws","waf","security"],"canonical":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2018-08-31-aws-waf-aws-shield-for-ddos-protection","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-08-22-investigating-web-cache-poisoning"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["http","caching","security"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-09-04-cloud-custodian-code-confusion"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","devops","security"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2589769190","3567236516"]}
