There are no reliable vulnerability databases, no security mailing lists maintained by library vendors, few or no details on security issues in release notes, and often, it is difficult to determine which versions of a library are affected by a specific reported vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, security does not appear to be a priority in the JavaScript library ecosystem. Popular vulnerability databases contain nearly no entries regarding JavaScript libraries.</p>\n<p>The results of this work highlight the need for more thorough and systematic approaches to JavaScript library inclusion and dependency management on the Web.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Thou shalt not depend on me: analysing the use of outdated JavaScript libraries on the web","date":"March 09, 2017","tags":["javascript","security"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-03-09-thou-shalt-not-depend-on-me-analysing-the-use-of-outdated-javascript-libraries-on-the-web","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-03-08-aws-request-ids"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","http","monitoring"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-04-14-amazons3encryptionclient-example"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","java","sdk","encryption"]}}}}}
