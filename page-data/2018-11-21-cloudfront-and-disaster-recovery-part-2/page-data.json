CloudFront already allows you to configure custom error pages or generate redirects with Lambda@Edge if your origin is unavailable. Now with Origin Failover, you can easily setup failover logic between combinations of AWS origins or non-AWS custom HTTP origins such that there is minimal interruption to your viewer’s experience. </p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"CloudFront and Disaster Recovery: Part 2","date":"November 21, 2018","tags":["aws","cloudfront","disasterrecovery"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-11-21-cloudfront-and-disaster-recovery-part-2","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-11-08-excited-about-azure-signalr-serviceaspnet-core-signalr"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["azure","dotnet","podcast"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-11-21-aws-cloud9-and-sharing-with-role-issue"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["aws","cloud9","iam"]}}}}}
