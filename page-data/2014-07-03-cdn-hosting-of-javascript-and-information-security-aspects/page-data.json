This also offers an advantage that if the visitor to your webpage has already downloaded a copy of jQuery from the same CDN, it won’t have to be re-downloaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am going to differentiate using a public, free CDN like <a href=\"http://code.jquery.com/\">jQuery CDN</a> or <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery\">Google Hosted Libraries</a> from using a paid product like <a href=\"http://www.akamai.com/html/solutions/dynamic-site-accelerator.html\">Dynamic Site Accelerator</a> from Akamai.  With the latter, you have an established business relationship that has been vetted around topics like uptime/SLA and security reviews.</p>\n<p>From an information security perspective, here are some items to consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Isn’t CDN hosting logically just another one of the <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting\">Types of Cross-Site Scripting</a>?  Yes, it is true that you injected the script yourself, but it is still loading a remote executable that has access to your data.  What if the CDN gets hacked?</li>\n<li>Not hosting the source code yourself means it may not be included in any static source code scanning performed on your build (like Veracode).</li>\n<li>You implicitly accept any <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/terms\">Termgenerals of Service</a> for your users, including any user or IP address tracking.  Is this compatible with your product’s terms of service?</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://jquery.com/download/#other-cdns\">Other CDNs</a> section on the jQuery site states “there may be delays between a jQuery release and its availability there”, which means if you have to push out a security fix, you need to wait for the CDN to deploy.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+IlyaGrigorik/posts/N8dDov8vWcM\">jQuery CDN HTTPS certificate expired on July 31</a> and caused a short outage.  So, in addition to not being in control of the code that is hosted, you don’t have control over if the site is functional or not.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In general, I like the idea of free hosting.  For a personal blog, where users may quickly pop in to read a post and maybe never come back, they serve an important purpose.  In fact, many of these CDNs have excellent operational and security characteristics.  However, for a paid product where we are trusted with the privacy of their data, these are essential points to consider.  I wouldn’t recommend a free CDN for the projects I am working on, but “your mileage may vary” so understand the risks vs. the rewards before taking general advice from the internet.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CDN Hosting of JavaScript and Information Security Aspects","date":"July 03, 2014","tags":["javascript","security","webdev"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2014-07-03-cdn-hosting-of-javascript-and-information-security-aspects","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-07-03-page-visibility-api"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript","ux","angularjs"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2014-07-31-reimagining-cobaltjs-preferences-in-angularjs-using-uml"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["javascript","architecture","uml"]}}}}}
