His background includes both .NET and Java, but he is most nostalgic about Lotus Notes. He has been developing professionally since 1994 and holds a Master‚Äôs degree in Software Engineering. When not staring at a computer screen, he is probably staring at another screen, either watching TV or playing video games with his family.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Securing GenAI apps: Fine-grained access control for Bedrock Agents (IAM451)</h3>\n<p>Want to secure generative AI applications accessing your organizational data? Learn how to implement intelligent access controls for Amazon Bedrock-powered applications accessing your organizational data. In this builders‚Äô session, you‚Äôll build a defense-in-depth approach that combines authentication using Amazon Cognito and fine-grained authorization with Amazon Verified Permissions to secure access for Bedrock AI agents. Implement layered permissions that protect sensitive data without limiting your GenAI capabilities. You must bring your laptop to participate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS re:Inforce 2025 (16 June 2025 - 18 June 2025)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Conversation with your Architecture</h3>\n<p>Software and architecture diagrams are critical tools as they help developers and stakeholders understand complex systems. What if you could have a conversation with your diagrams? This session explores how generative AI can facilitate meaningful conversations with your architecture to gain deeper insights, make decisions, generate diagrams, and even generate infrastructure code. Leave with both a theoretical understanding and practical implementation guidance for using generative AI in architecture documentation and analysis.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Source North (29 May 2025) (with Jenna Pederson)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Harnessing generative AI to create &#x26; understand architecture diagrams (ARC308)</h3>\n<p>This builders‚Äô session explores using generative AI to create and comprehend architecture diagrams, a critical aspect of software design and communication. Diagrams are often image data, custom formats of drawing programs, or text-based representations from diagram-as-code tools. Techniques are used from two different layers of the generative AI stack, Amazon Q Developer and foundational models on Amazon Bedrock. Chat-based workflows first understand and analyze existing diagrams, and then ask follow-up questions about best practices. New diagrams are created using diagram-as-code formats. Leave with practical strategies for harnessing generative AI in your software architecture workflows. You must bring your laptop to participate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS re:Invent 2024 (2 December 2024 - 6 December 2024) ( <a href=\"https://catalog.workshops.aws/generative-ai-architecture-diagrams\">workshop</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Fine-Grained Authorization in Modern Software Applications</h3>\n<p>Authentication (AuthN) and Authorization (AuthZ) are critical for most software applications. The increased adoption of standardized frameworks for AuthN has improved overall security posture. ‚ÄúBroken Authentication‚Äù was #2 risk on the OWASP Top 10:2017 list but slid in 2021 to be part of a rescoped #7. AuthZ is trending the wrong direction with ‚ÄúBroken Access Control‚Äù the #1 security risk on 2021 list. This session discusses how open-source policy languages and evaluation engines can improve access control in applications.</p>\n<p>The key acronyms are reviewed for background: JWT concepts (claims, scopes); access control models (RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC), data-flow model of XACML (PAP, PDP, PEP, PIP). Examples of applications requiring fine-grained authorization are modeled using different open-source solutions (Cedar, OpenFGA, OPA) focusing on their policy language and evaluation engine integration. This session spans high-level architecture to low-level code, and sprinkles humor (and acronyms) throughout.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>That Conference (30 July 2024 - 1 August 2024) ( <a href=\"https://github.com/hakanson/that2024/blob/main/Fine-Grained%20Authorization%20in%20Modern%20Software%20Applications.pdf\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hakanson/that2024\">code</a> )</li>\n<li>AWS NAMER Tech Summit 2024 (17 September 2024 - 19 September 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Using Cedar to secure application authorization (OPS301)</h3>\n<p>Cedar is an open source authorization policy language designed to be ergonomic, fast, safe, and analyzable. Rather than embedding authorization logic in an application‚Äôs code, developers write that logic as Cedar policies and delegate access decisions to Cedar‚Äôs evaluation engine. Cedar supports common authorization use cases with readable policies, naturally supporting concepts from role-based, attribute-based, and relation-based access control models. In this chalk talk, learn how to build a secure application delegating all authorization decisions to Cedar, and then see how to use Cedar together with Amazon Verified Permissions to control access to Amazon API Gateway APIs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Summit Washington, DC (26 June 2024 - 27 June 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cedar policy language in action</h3>\n<p>Cedar is a language for defining permissions as policies that describe who should have access to what. Amazon Verified Permissions and AWS Verified Access use Cedar to define fine-grained permissions for applications and end users. In this builders‚Äô session, first learn how to write Cedar policies. Then, take on a challenge problem building the set of policies representing a full application. This session uses open source Cedar and the free online playground, so there is no need to install anything or have an AWS account. You must bring your laptop to participate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS re:Inforce 2023 (13 June 2023 - 14 June 2023) ( <a href=\"https://catalog.workshops.aws/cedar-policy-language-in-action\">workshop</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-examples/tree/main/cedar-policy-language-in-action\">code</a>  )</li>\n<li>AWS re:Invent 2023 (27 November 2023 - 1 December 2023)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Build On AWS weekly - Go Apps on AWS - CDK üíú Go</h3>\n<p>This episode reviewed different options for deploying Go based services on AWS, starting with a code-based service using AWS App Runner, then container-based using CDK (also written in Go) to deploy to both Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Twitch Channel (23 March 2023) ( <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1773342293\">video</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Resilience on AWS</h3>\n<p>Resilience refers to the ability for workloads to respond and quickly recover from failures. Workloads deployed to the AWS cloud follow the Shared Responsibility Model separating resilience ‚Äúof‚Äù the cloud from workloads running ‚Äúin‚Äù the cloud. Part of a workload‚Äôs responsibility is to think about resilience threat modeling, the scenarios where things could go wrong, and the cost, business, or mission impact. This session will review strategies and design considerations around resilience, and reference how some AWS Public Sector customers are building resilience into their mission-focused workloads.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code Freeze 2023 (12 January 2023)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Build On AWS weekly - Code me some diagrams</h3>\n<p>This episode reviewed diagram types, when teams should create architecture diagrams, when to choose diagrams-as-code instead of presentation software or drawing tools, and sprinkled in a bit of fun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Twitch Channel (15 December 2022) ( <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1679798127\">video</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Run your Go applications on the cloud (BOA104)</h3>\n<p>Start building deployment pipelines for your Go applications on the cloud. You‚Äôve been running Go applications on your machine, but how do you run these in the cloud? In this chalk talk, discuss an easy-to-deploy pipeline for the development, testing, building, and deployment of applications written in Go. Although this example is tailored to Go, it can be easily modified to deploy applications written in other languages too. Join this chalk talk to learn how to deploy your application as containers from GitHub to the cloud with AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CDK, and AWS CodeDeploy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS re:Invent 2022 (28 November 2022 - 2 December 2022) ( <a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/events/Summits/reinvent2022/BOA104_Run-your-Go-applications-on-the-cloud.pdf\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/aws-samples/hello-go-cdk\">code</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sharpen your ‚ÄúArchitecture Documentation‚Äù Saw: Architectural Decision Records (ADR) and Diagrams-as-Code</h3>\n<p>All solutions implicitly have an architecture, ideally one which is both intentional and documented. The Architectural Decision Records (ADR) process distributes architectural decision-making across team members. Accelerate the time consuming process of hand drawing diagrams by rendering from a text-based source. Communicate effectively by committing both your markdown-based ADRs and text-based diagrams into your source code repository. This talk will review these techniques, provide actionable steps to adoption, and even live-code some examples.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS WWPS SLG/EDU xTech Solutions Architect offsite (23-24 August 2022)</li>\n<li>Open Source North (24 May 2023) ( <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/kevinhakanson/sharpen-your-architectural-documentation-saw\">presentation</a>)</li>\n<li>Minnesota Developers Conference 2023 (3 October 2023) ( <a href=\"https://github.com/hakanson/mdc2023/blob/main/Sharpen%20your%20%22Architectural%20Documentation%22%20Saw.pdf\">presentation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/hakanson/mdc2023\">code</a> )</li>\n<li>Twin Cities .NET User Group (7 December 2023)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Building SaaS on AWS - Multi-Tenant Data on S3</h3>\n<p>In this episode we chat about best practices and patterns to adopt when dealing with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/partitioning-and-isolating-multi-tenant-saas-data-with-amazon-s3/\">Partitioning and Isolating Multi-Tenant SaaS Data with Amazon S3</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS Twitch Channel (3 August 2022) ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fryghbOuIFE\">video</a> )</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Accelerate building your demo web app with an AWS UI template</h3>\n<p>Customer-facing builders (including AWS Solutions Architects like myself) want to create great looking demo web apps and AWS Samples.
