The other day, I was having a Slack conversation with a co-worker when he replied "true" in agreement with a statement I was making.  My first instinct was to respond "Double True!" due to the [SNL Digital Short: Lazy Sunday](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/snl-digital-short-lazy-sunday/n12003?snl=1).

Full lyrics for this December 2005 masterpiece can be found at [THE LONELY ISLAND LYRICS - Lazy Sunday](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lonelyisland/lazysunday.html), but the relevant lines are these:

> (Well let's hit up Yahoo Maps to find the dopest route!)  
> I prefer MapQuest (that's a good one too)  
> Google Maps is the best (true dat) DOUBLE TRUE!

I had totally forgotten about Yahoo Maps, which made me wonder what happened to that service. The URL no longer works and [Yahoo! Maps - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Maps) gave me this timeline:

> **Shutdown**  
> On June 4, 2015, Yahoo! announced that Yahoo! Maps would be shut down, along with Yahoo! Pipes, at the end of the month.
>
> As of 28 April 2016, Yahoo! Maps can still be accessed at [https://maps.yahoo.com/b/](https://maps.yahoo.com/b/) 
>
> As of 24 October 2016, Yahoo! Maps is no longer showing any data.
>
> As of 6 November 2016, Yahoo! Maps (maps.yahoo.com) redirects to a Yahoo! Search for the word "maps".

As much as I like to say "double true," my favorite line from [Lazy Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_Sunday_(The_Lonely_Island_song)) is this one:

> (You can call us Aaron Burr) from the way we're droppin Hamiltons

Interestingly, "Hamiltons" almost had the same fate as Yahoo Maps (see [Jack Lew nears decision to keep Hamilton on front of $10 bill, put a woman on the $20 - Apr. 16, 2016](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/16/news/economy/jack-lew-hamilton-10-bill/) ), but I don't think a hit Broadway musical would have made any difference for Yahoo Maps.
