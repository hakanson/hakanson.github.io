Why take the risk of a live demo?  Because my mentor, said it would be “awesome” - and he was right.</p>\n<p>When my mentor first mentioned the demo idea, I wasn’t sure how I was going to build it.  As luck would have it, I saw an internal posting highlighting an IBM partnership on October 8.  (Luck being defined by the famous quote: “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity”)  IBM Watson Developer Cloud has services for both <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html\">Text to Speech</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html\">Speech to Text</a>, including sample code that runs in the browser.  This looked promising given my JavaScript and web development background. I spent the following weekend understanding the sample code and getting those projects running.  Then, a couple of nights of some ugly code hacking and I had a demo to present.</p>\n<p>I’m glad the demo (mostly) worked out, but I’m even happier that I got to write some code and learn something new.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"2025 Customer Challenge Demo Experience","date":"October 28, 2015","tags":["innovation","vui","javascript"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2015-10-28-2025-customer-challenge-demo-experience","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-09-28-replacement-strategy-for-google-search-appliance"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["webdev","search"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2015-12-09-chrome-dev-summit-2015-notes"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["webdev"]}}}}}
